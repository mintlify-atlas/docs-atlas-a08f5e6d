---

Get up and running with Esoteric Network by creating an account, setting up your profile, and publishing your first piece of esoteric writing, art, or philosophy.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- A valid email address
- A unique username (3-32 characters)
- A password (8-32 characters)

## Create Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Sign Up">
    Visit the Esoteric Network homepage and click **Sign Up** in the navigation bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Out the Registration Form">
    The signup form requires three fields, all validated using Zod schemas:

    ```typescript
    // Validation schema from lib/types/user.ts
    export const SIGNUPSCHEMA = object({
      email: string({ required_error: "Email is required" })
        .min(1, "Email is required")
        .email("Invalid email"),
      password: string({ required_error: "Password is required" })
        .min(1, "Password is required")
        .min(8, "Password must be more than 8 characters")
        .max(32, "Password must be less than 32 characters"),
      userName: string({ required_error: "UserName is required" })
        .min(1, "UserName is required")
        .max(32, "UserName must be less than 32 characters"),
    })
    ```

    <Note>
      Your username must be unique across the platform and will be visible to other users.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit and Authenticate">
    When you click **Create Account**, the system:
    
    1. Hashes your password using Argon2 (memoryCost: 19456, timeCost: 2)
    2. Checks for existing username/email conflicts
    3. Creates your user record in the database
    4. Generates a Lucia session cookie
    5. Redirects you to `/home`

    ```typescript
    // Password hashing from server/actions/user.ts
    const hashedPassword = await hash(password, {
      memoryCost: 19456,
      timeCost: 2,
      outputLen: 32,
      parallelism: 1
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set Up Your Profile (Optional)

After creating your account, you can customize your profile:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Profile Settings">
    Click your avatar in the navigation bar and select **Edit Profile**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Profile Picture">
    - Click the upload area or drag and drop an image
    - Crop your image to fit
    - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
    - Images are uploaded to Vercel Blob storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Bio">
    Add a bio to tell the community about your spiritual journey, philosophical interests, or creative practice.
    
    <Tip>
      Your bio supports plain text and is displayed on your public profile.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create Your First Post

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Create">
    Click **Create** in the navigation menu to open the post editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Title">
    Enter a compelling title for your post in the title field. This is displayed prominently in the feed.
    
    ```tsx
    // Title input from app/create/editor.tsx
    <Input 
      placeholder="Enter your Title"
      onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}
      className="text-xl md:text-4xl h-[60px]"
    />
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Content">
    Use the TipTap rich text editor to compose your post. The editor supports:
    
    - **Text formatting**: Bold, italic, strikethrough, code
    - **Headings**: H1, H2, H3
    - **Lists**: Bullet points and numbered lists
    - **Media**: Images and YouTube embeds
    - **Code blocks**: Syntax-highlighted code snippets
    - **Links**: Inline and external links

    <Info>
      Content is stored as JSON in the database, allowing rich formatting while maintaining structure.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish">
    Click **Publish** to save your post. The system will:
    
    1. Serialize the editor content to JSON
    2. Create a post record with a unique ID (using CUID2)
    3. Associate it with your user account
    4. Revalidate the `/home` feed
    5. Redirect you to your published post

    ```typescript
    // Post creation from server/actions/post.ts
    export const CreatePostAction = async ({ title, content }: { 
      title: string, 
      content: string 
    }) => {
      const { user } = await validateUser()
      const postId = await db.insert(PostTable).values({
        title: title!,
        content: content!,
        userId: user?.id!
      }).returning({ postId: PostTable.id });
      
      revalidatePath("/home")
      return postId[0].postId
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Explore and Engage

Now that you've published your first post, you can:

- **Browse the feed**: View posts from other seekers on `/home`
- **Like posts**: Click the heart icon to show appreciation
- **Edit your posts**: Navigate to your profile and click **Edit** on any of your posts
- **Manage your profile**: Update your bio and avatar anytime

<Tip>
  Posts appear in reverse chronological order on the home feed. New posts are automatically added to the top.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Account creation fails with 'Username already exists'">
  Choose a different username. Usernames must be unique across the platform. The system checks for conflicts before creating your account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Password validation fails">
  Ensure your password meets these requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Maximum 32 characters
  - Required (cannot be empty)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Post doesn't appear in feed">
  Posts are added to the feed immediately after publishing via Next.js revalidation. Try refreshing the `/home` page. If the issue persists, check that you're signed in and that the post was successfully created (you should have been redirected to `/post/{postId}`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Image upload fails">
  - Check that your image is under 4.5MB
  - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
  - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
  - The upload uses Vercel Blob storage which requires proper API configuration
</Accordion>
